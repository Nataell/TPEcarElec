## Description

Am'app is a mobile application for *iOS* and *Android*. It allows the linking between the local farmers and AMAPs (association for the maintain of proximity agriculture or in french Association pour le Maintien d'une agriculture de proximit√©) with potential clients.
The application is separated in distinct parts :

* A product catalog provided by AMAPs and local farmer.
* A meal catalog, also provided by AMAPs and local farmers.
* A collaborative recipe catalog based on a healthy alimentation philosophy.

These three catalogs are stored in a databased shared between, the Am'app application and the Am'manager website.

## Functionalities

* The client, who uses the Am'app application to order products, meal, follow and concoct recipes.
* The supplier, who can sell product and meal with application.

## Software used

[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) is the main framework used. It allows to easily create a web application with a mobile viewport.

[Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) is used to deploy a web based application on mobile operating systems. It deploys it on Android and iOS.

# Building Instruction

## Prerequisites

To fork the application, you need to first install a minimum of software. We describe the minimum of software that you'll need to install to run the application only on your computer.

1. First [download nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer. On linux the binary is named ```node``` but a binary named ```nodejs``` is required. The trick is to link it with the above command:
```
sudo ln -s "$(which node)" /usr/bin/nodejs
```

2. Check the installation inside a terminal with ```npm -v``` and ```node -v```.
3. Follow the [Ionic guide](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started#cli): download the ionic command line tool with
```
npm install -g ionic
```
4. For windows install a [git bash client](https://git-scm.com/download/win) of your choice (you can also use the provided link if your lazy.)

## Basic install

These instructions are valid for a Linux OS. The commands for Windows are the same inside the git bash terminal.
1. You first need to clone the project to use it:
```
git clone https://github.com/Nataell/TPEcarElec.git
```

2. Go to the repository: ```cd TPEcarElec```

3. Get the most recent version using the git tag ```git checkout latest```.

4. Install the needed packages for the project with ```npm update```.

5. Run the local server to use the app ```ionic serve```

## More information

For specific Android installation, follow the **INSTALL.md** file. **We didn't use iOS, so you will need to find yourself how to use Ionic with iOS**.
